Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions over the project.

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for TTN. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out [the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### **How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](../GitHubissues). Create an issue on the repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

   + **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

   + **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started the module, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal.

   + **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks.](../Markdowncodeblocks) 

   + **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

   + **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action,** describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:   

  + **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of cloudformation) or was this always a problem?

   + If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Cloudformation?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Terraform from the releases page.

   + **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

   + If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for TTN AWS modules, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.


**How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](../GitHubissues). Create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

  
   + **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.

   + **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.

   + **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks.](../Markdowncodeblocks)

   + **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

   + **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of code which the suggestion is related. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.

   + **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Terraform users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community package.

   + **Specify which version of Terraform you're using.** You can get the exact version by running terraform -v in your terminal.

   + **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

## Pull Request Process

A pull request works by allowing developers to create new features or squash bugs without affecting the main project code or what the users are seeing. This way, they are able to write and test code changes locally without having to worry about breaking the overall product.

Pull requests follow a basic five step process:

   
   + **Fork Main Repository and Create a Local Clone.** First, the developer creates a fork of the main repository, and then clones this onto their local machine.

   + **Make Needed Changes Locally.** The developer then is able to make their needed changes or additions to the code whether they are working on resolving an issue or new feature.

   + **Push Local Changes to Forked Repository.** Once the developer has completed and tested the new code changes, they push these changes back to the forked repository they created in step one.

   + **Make a Pull Request.** This is where the actual pull request takes place! After requesting a pull request, the main repository maintainer is alerted for review. The maintainer will then review the work done in the developer’s forked repository, and then make any comments or request any edits that need to be made for approval.

   + Any edits are then sent back to the developer for additional commits (changes to code) that may be needed.
    If no edits are needed, the pull request is approved by the maintainer.

   + **Merge with Main Project.** Once the repository maintainer has approved a pull request, the developer’s new updates in the forked repository are merged with the main project repository. The product is then updated with the new feature or bug fix, and can now be viewed by end users.

## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to TTN? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:


   + **beginner** - issues that should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

   + **help-wanted** - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by the total number of comments. While not perfect, the number of comments is a reasonable proxy for the impact a given change will have.
